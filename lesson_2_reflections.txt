What happens when you initialize a file repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You create a place in memory to record commits. You need to do it because all git functions operate
	on this file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a medium between the working directory and the repository? It's value is organizational.
	I offers one the chance to see what you are doing and act upon it before you actually "commit"to it.
