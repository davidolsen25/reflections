When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would use a remote repository especially if you want to share your work
    with others, publicly or privately, or work on someone else's project. I suppose
    you could also safeguard your work by saving on GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to introduce changes from the remote to your code for security reasons. With manual pulls you can survey the commits before you pull them into your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches exist in any git scenario and are a record of the commits which travels back to the beginning along a path. A Clone can exist in a local repository or on a GitHub environment and is an exact copy of all brancheds and commits at a certain time. A Fork is a clone of a repository which exists on GitHub and points back to the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you have it stored, you can see what changes anyone has made since you last fetched the remote "name/branch" by using git log or git diff.
