When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would use a remote repository especially if you want to share your work
    with others, publicly or privately, or work on someone else's project. I suppose
    you could also safeguard your work by saving on GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to introduce changes from the remote to your code for security reasons. With manual pulls you can survey the commits before you pull them into your local repository.
